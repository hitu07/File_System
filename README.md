This project contains a collection of SQL queries written for the AdventureWorks2019 database.
The queries cover a variety of real-world business scenarios, including retrieving, analyzing, and manipulating data related to sales, employees, products, and customers.

The project was developed as part of my internship at Celebel Technologies, where I solved 42 SQL queries with an emphasis on writing simplified, optimized, and easy-to-understand solutions.
